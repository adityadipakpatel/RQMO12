# RareQuest - Team 12 RQMO

## RareQuest

A web game for promoting the awareness and challenges of establishing a diagnosis for rare diseases

## The Issue

Rare diseases pose a unique diagnostic challenge because of limited research and awareness. This can create obstacles for patients and healthcare providers alike. By increasing understanding of these challenges, we can foster empathy, promote education about rare diseases, and encourage support for those affected.

## Our Magic Solution

Our solution is an interactive game where the player becomes an investigator determined to uncover Sam's mystery illness. Players will guide Sam's journey, analyzing medical information and researching potential diagnoses.  The game highlights the challenges of diagnosing rare diseases, encourages critical thinking, and promotes determination to find answers for those facing difficult medical situations.

## How it works

### 1. Visit doctors to learn about symptoms

Players will move around the map to interact with different doctors to learn more about the symptoms Sam is experiencing.

### 2. Play mini games

Players will play mini games after meeting a doctor to examine the treatment plan outlined for Sam.

### 3. The difficulties of rare disease diagnosis

The player has journeyed through the intricate process of diagnosing a rare disease, visiting numerous doctors to uncover the challenges faced by those with such conditions.
