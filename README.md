A web-based, pixel art, RPG game for promoting the awareness and challenges of establishing a diagnosis for rare diseases. Built for the [Quebec Coalition of Orphan Diseases](https://rqmo.org/mission/), a non-profit organization for raising awareness about the challenges of rare diseases, as part of [Morgan Stanley's 2024 Code to Give](https://codetogive.bemyapp.com/#/event) hackathon.

## The Issue

Rare diseases pose a unique diagnostic challenge because of limited research and awareness. This can create obstacles for patients and healthcare providers alike. By increasing understanding of these challenges, we can foster empathy, promote education about rare diseases, and encourage support for those affected.

## Our Magic Solution

Our solution is an interactive game where the player becomes an investigator determined to uncover Sam's mystery illness. Players will guide Sam's journey, analyzing medical information and researching potential diagnoses.  The game highlights the challenges of diagnosing rare diseases, encourages critical thinking, and promotes determination to find answers for those facing difficult medical situations.
